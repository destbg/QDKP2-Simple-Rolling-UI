# DKP2 Simple rolling UI
 
DKP2 Simple rolling UI is an addon for guilds utilizing DKP (Dragon Kill Points) systems in World of Warcraft. Building upon the functionality of the DKP2 addon, DKP2 Simple rolling UI offers you a better loot distribution process with a streamlined user interface (inspired by the LootReserve addon's rolling UI).

With DKP2 Simple rolling UI, managing loot rolls becomes easier. The addon features a simple UI, prominently displaying the item currently up for rolls, along with the current bet.

DKP2 Simple rolling UI simplifies player interaction with the roll system by providing two buttons: one for passing a roll and another for adding a bet.

Compatible with: World of Warcraft (Cataclysm)
